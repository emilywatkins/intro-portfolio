            <h3>about me</h3>
            <p>my formal education is in music performance. i have a master's degree. but what i learned along the way is that i only enjoy one small component of being a musician: problem solving. over the past few years i've been inching my way closer to a career a bit heavier in problem solving and what better way to enjoy problem solving than to learn computer programming.</p>
            <p>nowadays i fill my time:
